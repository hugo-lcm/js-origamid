                <h2>Fox</h2>
                <p>Foxes are small to medium-sized, omnivorous mammals belonging to several genera of the family
                    Canidae. They have a flattened skull, upright triangular ears, a pointed, slightly upturned snout,
                    and a long bushy tail (or brush).</p>
                <p>Twelve species belong to the monophyletic "true foxes" group of genus Vulpes. Approximately another
                    25 current or extinct species are always or sometimes called foxes; these foxes are either part of
                    the paraphyletic group of the South American foxes, or of the outlying group, which consists of the
                    bat-eared fox, gray fox, and island fox.</p>
                <p>Foxes live on every continent except Antarctica. The most common and widespread species of fox is the
                    red fox (Vulpes vulpes) with about 47 recognized subspecies.[2] The global distribution of foxes,
                    together with their widespread reputation for cunning, has contributed to their prominence in
                    popular culture and folklore in many societies around the world. The hunting of foxes with packs of
                    hounds, long an established pursuit in Europe, especially in the British Isles, was exported by
                    European settlers to various parts of the New World.</p>
